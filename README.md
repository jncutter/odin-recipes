# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of basic html
by building a recipe website. This project will make use of elements that
hold text information and elements that can link to other pages.

I may also use basic styling in this assignment. While not a part of
the actual assignment I would like the final product to look somewhat nice.
