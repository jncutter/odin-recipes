    <p>Steamed brown rice mixed with sautéed broccoli. This is a great side dish, and I honestly enjoy it more than my main dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brown rice</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out brown rice into a pot, 1/4 cup is a single serving</li>
        <li>Put double that volume in water into the pot (if you used 1/4 cup of rice then use 1/2 cup of water)</li>
        <li>Season the water with salt, 1/8 tsp of salt per 1/4 cup of rice</li>
        <li>Heat pot on high heat until water begins to boil</li>
        <li>Turn heat to low, and cook for 45 minutes</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking prep and cook the broccoli</li>
        <li>Use a food processor to blend the broccoli to small chunks, or cut it into small pieces (include stalk)</li>
        <li>1 cup of broccoli chunks is a serving, if there are any leftovers they can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days</li>
        <li>Heat pan to medium high heat with some olive oil</li>
        <li>Put the broccoli in the heated pan and season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Sauté the broccoli, stir continuously</li>
        <li>This should only take a couple of minutes, as it cooks the broccoli will turn a darker green and start to brown</li>
        <li>When the broccoli is cooked to your liking take it off of the heat</li>
        <li>Mix together the rice and broccoli</li>
    </ol>
